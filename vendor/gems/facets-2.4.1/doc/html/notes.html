            <h1>Release Notes</h1>
<p>
Facets 2.4 is a major step forward for Facets. It is perhaps the release
that 2.0 should have been, but of course it took the actual 2.0 release to
make 2.4 possible. Some annoyances you may have encountered in updating
your code to 2.0 are now fixed. And from 2.4 on, Facets will now be
settling down into simple refinement release cycles.
</p>
<p>
The main change under the hood is to bring everything up to the top
lib/facets/ directory. No longer are the libraries sorted by category. I
had done so for a long time to make it easier to track the various libs,
but in the end it was only making it more diffcult to deal with build tools
and packaging.
</p>
<p>
For the end-user, the largest change is a new emphisis on:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter- intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantantages to do this for the sake of
interoperability than the practice of cherry-picking. The reason is simply
because others may have cherry-picked different methods, and those
distinctions go unaccounted and untested.
</p>
<p>
Also with this release, to bolster the use of require &#8216;facets&#8217;,
some lack-luster extensions have been deprecated and namespace usage has
been improved. In addition, we are getting very close to full
ActiveSupport, and Ruby 1.9, interoperability. Expect this to be complete
in the next minor release or two.
</p>
<p>
This is still a bit of an early release. There remain a few libraries to
adjust for the new design considerations, but I wanted to get this new
design out as soon as possible so others could adjust their code sooner
rather than later. I&#8217;ll be catching up on the CHANGES list over the
next few minor release.
</p>
<h2>As of 2.3</h2>
<p>
Amoung other changes with this release, cloneable.rb is now a true deep
dup/clone mixin; tracepoint.rb returns to the library.
</p>
<h2>As of 2.2.1:</h2>
<p>
This release get rid of the underlying methods subdir. All method redirects
are now in core, to ensure there are no more name clashes.
</p>
<h2>As of 2.2.0:</h2>
<p>
This release provides improved rdocs and prepares facets for use with RUby
1.9. It also adds Matthew Harris&#8217; duration.rb library. Bug thanks to
Matthew!
</p>
<h2>As of 2.1.0:</h2>
<p>
Major changes include a new and much-improved command.rb, a new BiCrypt
class for simple two-way crypotgraphy, as well as attr_reader!,
attr_writer! and attr_accessor! for flag attributes, plus alias_xxx methods
for all attr_xxx methods.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
