WORK IN PROGRESS
================

**This repo is not ready for deployment!**

This repository is part of an ongoing project to split the [calagator project](http://github.com/calagator/calagator/) into a Rails engine with a separate Rails shell on top. This repo will become the Rails shell for the [Calagator.org](http://calagator.org) deployment.
