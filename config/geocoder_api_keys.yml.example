# Geocoding and mapping use API keys from this file.
#
# For geocoding during development, you can copy this example file 
# to config/geocoder_api_keys.yml, and sign up for your own key:
#
# - Sign into Google as yourself, and go to
#   http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
# 
# - Read the terms, check the box, then enter the URL at which you
#   access your development instance: probably 
#   "http://localhost:3000/" or "http://127.0.0.1:3000/".
#   If you're entering a real domain name, you probably want to 
#   enter something like "http://foo.com/", *without* the "www" 
#   or any trailing path, just because that makes the key most 
#   useful to you -- see this FAQ for details:
#   http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=55146&topic=10945
#
# - Enter your key in both places below, and keep a copy of your key
#   in a safe place; don't share it (though I don't expect anyone to 
#   exceed Google's limit of 50,000 geocodings per day!). You won't 
#   check in your own geocoder_api_keys.yml; Subversion has already 
#   been told to ignore yours :-)

development:
  google: "YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE"

production:
  google: "YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE"

# (No test key needed: the tests stub out geocoding so that we test our
# own code without calling Google.)
