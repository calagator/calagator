SUMMARY:Substance Summit
DESCRIPTION: [Full details at http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/834270/ ] The first in a series of conversations with the Portland creative community to help each other understand how we can be more inclusive\, collaborative and effective. We have been inspired by Portland's creative technology community (Legion of Tech and Silicon Florist to name a few) to help facilitate an environment where we share ideas and create a place that draws the best talent and the best clients to Portland to get the best creative work possible.
      
      This is the first of many conversations. We don't expect to solve the world's problems\, let alone ours\, over one beer (or two\, or three...). But if we're going to start\, it might as well be here and now.
      
      Location is the Lucky Lab NW Beer Hall
