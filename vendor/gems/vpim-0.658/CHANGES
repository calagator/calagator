0.657 - 2008-08-14

- Date#to_time renamed to Date#vpim_to_time. Apparently Rails also patches the core.

- Debian doesn't like RFCs. I think there is a problem with the DFG, not the
  IETF.  The value of a standard is that it can't be modified (if anybody could
  publish a modified version of an RFC without restriction chaos would ensue).
  Still, we lost that argument, and I'll try and help packagers out.

- View, gives various views of calendars. Experimental.

- Fixed doc comment refs to common Property module.

- Vtodo#duration and #due now work correctly (the missing one will be calculated
  from the other).

- Vevent::Maker#add_rrule, #set_rrule are new, using Rrule::Maker.

- There is now (half-of) an Rrule::Maker class to help construct RRULE values.

- Vjournal can be encoded now (it was broken).

- Better code coverage by the tests.

- Recurrence#occurrences now returns an Enumerator instead of an Rrule. Both
  have #each, and both yield the same thing, so that isn't an API change. However,
  Rrule had an each_until, and the Enumerator doesn't. Use the dountil argument
  to #occurrences to get the same effect. The asymetry of this API caused me
  (non-aesthetic) trouble, now Rrule is an internal implementation detail.
  Also, this would have had to change eventually, because occurrences need to
  be the union of multiple RRULE and RDATE fields.

- Recurrence#rrule, returns an Rrule for the first RRULE field. Can be used
  as transition.

- Icalendar#calscale was broken, and is now unit tested, along with #version
  and #protocol?.

- Icalendar#{each,events,todos,journals} all yield components, or return an
  enumerator.

- Icalendar is enumerable.

- Repo and Repo::Calendar are enumerable.

- #occurrences will call Rrule#each if a block is provided

- Recurrence rules with DTSTART in UTC will now sortof work (thanks to Max
  Werner for providing the patch).

- Added convenience methods for setting and getting title and org fiels (thanks
  to Jade Meskill for providing the patch).

- Modified Icalendar#create2 so only prodid can be supplied and cal is yielded
  so events/etc. can be pushed.

- Support Highrisehq.com's broken google talk field (see test_vcard.rb for
  examples, thanks to Terry Tong for reporting).


0.619 - 2008-03-30

- Fixed some problems with rescue statements not being specific enough.

- Vcard#birthday may now return a DateTime.

- Added Vcard#urls

- Fixed a mispelled Uri in Vcard#url

- Global fix of misspellings of "occurrence"

- KAddressBook compatibility fix - allow / in field names, even though it is
  illegal in vCard 3.0.


0.604 - 2008-03-13

- Fixed a bug with lower-case UTF-16 encoded cards not being detected properly.

- Skip over invalidly encoded vCard fields when enumerating them.


0.602 - 2008-03-12

- Updated reminder utility to work with iCal 3.

- Reworked gem to include tests, samples, and binaries.


0.597 - 2008-03-01

- Support for BYSETPOS in recurrence rules (development supported by ZipDX.com)

- Support for FREQ=weekly in recurrence rules (development supported by ZipDX.com)

- Fixed an encode_text() bug (patch supplied by Jan Becvar)

- Fixed problem with interaction between BYMONTH and BYDAY (patch supplied by
  Sam Stephenson of 32signals.com)

- Vevent::Maker - Started adding high-level iCalendar encoding APIs

- Vpim::Vcard::Maker - the vCard maker is moved here

- Vpim::Maker - deprecated

- Vcard::make, Maker::Vcard#delete_if - new

- Vcard::Maker#add_name - deprecate, see Vcard::Maker#name

- Vcard::Maker#fullname= - deprecate, see Vcard::Maker#name

- Added high-level vCard decoding API.

- Beginning to depend on ruby1.8. I'm willing to try for backwards compat if I
  get feedback that this causes difficulties.

- Icalendar#components - new

- Icalendar#vevents - deprecated, see Icalendar#components

- split Vtodo and Vjournal into own files

- Added Recurrence module to Vtodo and Vjournal

- Property::Common#sequence - new

- Property::Common#attachments - new

- Icalendar::Attachment - new

- Maker::Vcard#add_url - new

- ex_mkyourown.rb - new example

- Modularized the component property accessor methods, and added lots of
  Icalendar property support for Vevent, Vtodo, and Vjournal.

- Fixed support for TEXT decoding.

- Use Subversion revision as release sub-version.

- It appears that a top-level vpim.rb that requires everything else is needed
  for ruby-gems, gemspec seems to work now.

- Don't package backup files (.../*.rb~).

- Icalendar decoding optimizations. Icalendar.decode is about twice as fast
  now, and more optimizations are scheduled.

- Continue the move to using uppercase for all syntactic elements that can be
  mixed case. The API might eventually allow only uppercase, it appears
  case-insensitive comparisons still have a noticeable effect on performance.


0.17 - 2006-03-08

- DirectoryInfo#delete - new

- Maker::Vcard#fullname - new

- Provide an example of how to create, copy, and modify version 2.1 vCards.

- Maker::Vcard.make2 - new

- Maker::Vcard.make - deprecated

- Profiled decoding of a huge iCalendar file. Performance appears to be
  dominated by overhead of String#downcase (20% of time spent in Field#name?).
  Keeping the field group, field name, and field's parameter's names internally
  in uppercase and using ruby 1.8's String#casecmp? is a first attempt at
  optimization. This is a change in the default case returned, but it aligns
  with the RFC and common usage.

- Maker::Vcard.make -  full_name is now optional, it will be derived from name/N:

- Maker::Vcard#add_field -  better argument checking

- Maker::Vcard#copy - new

- Vcard#[] -  now limits return to fields with values

- Vcard#name - new 

- Vcard::Name - new 

- Vcard#nicknames - new 

- Field#params and Field#param - deprecated and undocumented, I could never
  remember the difference

- Field#pnames - new

- Field#pvalues - new

- Methods.casecmp? - new

- Field#pref= - new

- Field#pvalue_idel - new

- Field#pvalue_iadd - new


0.16 - 2006-02-19

- Packaged in gem format, experimental.

- Read vCards in UTF-8 or UTF-16, big or little endian, with or without a byte
  order mark (BOM).

- Fixed bug with rrule occurences containing the end of the interval. Reported
  with patch by Brad Ediger.

0.15 - 2005-07-29

- Fixed bug with param values with quoted strings, particularly a quoted string
  containing a : character, like
    name;param="file:///":value

  Thanks to Tamiji Homma for reporting this and sending me an example calendar.

- Vtodo.create - new
- Icalendar#push - allow Vtodos to be added

  Thanks to Maximillian Dornseif for contributing the above two Vtodo patches.

- Vevent.duration - bug fixes so duration can be calculated from begin/end, and
  end can be calculated from begin/duration

- Vcard#nickname that strips whitespace to see if there really is a nickname

- Vcard#birthday - returns birthday as a date

- Vevent#create_yearly - easy, cheesy way to create yearly recurring events

- vcf-to-ics.rb: example of how to create calendars of bdays from vcards

- Icalendar.create()  like Vevent.create(), it will take arrays of Fields, or
  Hashes of String => value.

- maker/vcard.rb: Added support for X-AIM, an Apple extension.

0.14 - 2005-02-01

- Fix: if an RRULE didn't ever yield an event (a bug in the rule) dountil was never tested.

- Change: don't throw an ArgumentError with infinite events, just stop when the
  Time is no longer representable

0.13 - 2005-01-20

- Was calling to_time with an arg, fixed.

0.12 - 2005-01-17

- Removed require of pp from the library and utilities where it wasn't needed,
  it was causing problems because it doesn't exist on ruby 1.6 systems.

- Added Field#to_date, returns field value as an array of Date objects
  
- Changed Field#to_time - it now auto-detects format of values
  (DATE/DATE-TIME),  and doesn't take/require a default_kind argument.

- Added IMPP support to Vpim::Maker::Vcard.

- Makefile wasn't copying the Maker classes into the release.

- Duration value not returned unless it was negative, fixed.

- An RRULE's UNTIL was always being assumed to be a DATE-TIME, but it can be a
  DATE. I fixed this, but is something of a hack, see comments and TODO.

- Use String#scan instead of String#gsub, when appropriate (I didn't know it
  existed when I stated the project).

- Run tests on 3 ruby versions.

- Don't include docs in release package, it makes it way too large.

- Change: use String.unpack instead of iconv to convert UCS-2 to UTF-8,
  removing dependency on iconv (it wasn't standard in ruby 1.6).

- Change: simplified mutt_ab_query.rb, and renamed to vcf-to-mutt.

- Change: reminder.rb sorts todo items by priority.

- New: Vtodo#priority - the priority of the vTodo component.

0.11 - 2004-11-17

- Added a Vpim::Maker::Vcard class to simplify the creation of vCards, modelled
  after the RSS maker from ruby's RSS library.

0.10 - 2004-11-07

- If events don't have a recurrence rule, they occur once, but they
  were being returned even if they occurred after "dountil". Fixed.

- New sample of converting tab-delimited files to a vcard file, from
  Dane G. Avilla. Thanks!

0.9a - 2004-10-31

- Made sure all events occur once in rrules.

- New sample of encoding: mutt-aliases-vcard.rb

- Added ToDo support to reminder.rb.

0.9 - 2004-06-17

- Field now is mutable, you can change the group, value, params, etc.

- Using the Enumerator object for DirectoryInfo now, instead of all the
each_by_X, and field_by_X() APIs.

- Moved homepage and docs to Ruby Forge.

- DirectoryInfo.create: added a profile argument

- DirectoryInfo#push: now pushes to 1 before the end

- DirectoryInfo#push_end: pushes onto end, in case you really want to

- Field.create: a Date or Time object value will now be encoded as date or time

- Vpim.encode_date(): encodes an RFC2425 date

- Vpim.encode_time(): encodes an RFC2425 time

- Vpim.encode_date_time(): encodes an RFC2425 date-time

- Icalendar#encode(): encodes an Icalendar

- Icalendar#push(): pushes a calendar component onto a calendar

- Vevent#accept(): accepts an event invitation

- Vevent#create(): creates a new event

- Address#copy(): create a copy of Address. If the original Address was frozen,
this one won't be.

- Address#partstat=(): set or change the PARTSTAT.

- Field#copy(): create a copy of Field. If the original Field was frozen, this
one won't be.

0.8 - 2004-04-01

- Moved DirectoryInfo::Field into it's own file, vpim/field.rb.

- New: Vpim::Duration - crude way of getting days/hours/mins/secs from a
duration in seconds.

- New: Icalendar#create() and Icalendar#create_reply()

- New: Icalendar#encode(), #to_s is an alias to #encode.

- New: Icalendar#protocol?()

- Change: Icalendar#version() raises an error if there is no VERSION

- Change: made all the DirectoryInfo, Vcard, and Field .new() class methods
private, and replaced with the 2 class methods:

 - decode() decodes a string, returning a ruby object
 - create() creates a new object

and all objects now get encoded using:

 - encode() takes a ruby object, and encodes it as a string

They become more symetrical, and the overloaded meanings of .new() dissappear -
with .new() are you decoding, encoding, creating...?

- Change: Icalendar::Vevent#attendees() can return only attendees
with a particular URI.

- New: Icalendar::Address#==()

- New: Icalendar::Vevent#attendee?()

- Fixed bug: Field#encode() was adding an unexpecte NL to the line.

- Change: Field#name?() can accept a symbol.

- New: DirectoryInfo has an #each(), so I included Enumerable. Because of this
#to_a() now returns all the Fields in a DirectoryInfo.

- New: DirectoryInfo#push() and DirectoryInfo@push_uniq().

- Change: DirectoryInfo#<<() is now an alias for  DirectoryInfo#push()

- Change: DirectoryInfo#each() and DirectoryInfo#each_by() now return self
instead of nil, I think this is more rubyish.

- New: Date#to_time() - converts a Date, and maybe a DateTime, to a Time

- New: Icalendar#protocol()

- New: Icalendar::Address

- New: Icalendar::Vevent#organizer()/attendees(), which return an
Icalendar::Address

- New: An array of all the values of fields named name, converted to text,
using Field.to_text().


0.7 - 2004-03-21

- Bug fixes, not all files were requiring vpim.rb, which had the definition of
the invalid encoding error.

- Implemented much requested feature: ignore empty lines in input. This is an
invalid encoding, but I'm tired of fighting it.


0.6 - 2004-03-20

WARNING: major API renamings!

- Replaced the Vpim::Errors::*Error exception classes with a single exception
class: Vpim::InvalidEncodingError. That, and a message, is all I really need.
I don't think people need different classes for different types of encoding
errors, either the library can decode it for them, or it can't.

- Renamed project to "vpim" (to reflect vCard and vCalendar/iCalendar support),
renamed top-level Rfc2425 module to Vpim, split vard.rb into multiple files.

- Add support for iCalendar (RFC2445), see vpim/icalendar.rb. Currently only
supports VEVENT, no VTODO or VALARM yet, but is useable to print my upcoming
iCal events.

- Implemented the iCalendar recurrence rules mini-language, which is possibly
of more general use than just for iCalendar.

- Fixed bug in time decoding where usec would be nil instead of zero when no
usec were present in the time value.

- Field#to_time now assumes that time is in local time, unless the timezone is
"Z", meaning UTC.

- Field#to_text - new method, unescapes newlines, commas, and escape
characters.

- Field#field(name) - new method, returns the first field named +name+.


0.5 - 3003-11-23

- ab-query.rb - short option for --me was mistyped as -v, instead of -m.

- mutt_ab_query.rb - added a --pipe option, so that the output of an other
script can be directly queried.

- New method: Rfc2425.version

- Decode vCard 2.1 abbreviated parameters (ones where the name of the parameter
is missing, only the value is present, which only works for type and encoding).

- Vcard.decode() now support UCS-2 encoded vCards, by translating anything that
looks like UCS-2 to UTF-8 before decoding.

0.4 - 2003-04-14

- More support for decoding date, time, and date-time values.

- New method Field#to_time().

- Can pass an IO object to decode APIs, its entire contents is read as a
string.

- Field#group?() now considers nil as equivalent to no group, so you can use
each_group(nil) to iterate through all fields without a group.

0.3 -

- Added description of how to use mutt_ab_query.rb

- Added support for querying the kind of a value, and began support for
decoding date and time values.

0.2 -

- Supports encoding.

- Supports accessing values using [].

- No longer have methods return an Array, or nil if the array is zero length, I
just return an Array.

- mutt_ab_query.rb - an example of using vcard.rb to do lookups in the OS X
Address Book from Mutt

0.1 -

- First release.
