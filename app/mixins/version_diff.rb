module VersionDiff
  
  # provides basic diff services between two given versions.
  # 
  # Examples:
  # @event.version_diff(1) # diff between 1 and head
  # @event.version_diff(1,2) # diff between 1 and 2
  # @event.version_diff(:head, 4) #diff between head and 4
  # @event.version_diff(3,:prev) # diff between 3 and 2
  # @event.version(:prev) # diff between head and prev
  #
