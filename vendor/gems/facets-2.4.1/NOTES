= Release Notes

Facets 2.4 is a major step forward for Facets. It is perhaps
the release that 2.0 should have been, but of course it took
the actual 2.0 release to make 2.4 possible. Some annoyances
you may have encountered in updating your code to 2.0 are now
fixed. And from 2.4 on, Facets will now be settling down into
simple refinement release cycles.

The main change under the hood is to bring everything up to
the top lib/facets/ directory. No longer are the libraries
sorted by category. I had done so for a long time to make
it easier to track the various libs, but in the end it was
only making it more diffcult to deal with build tools and 
packaging.

For the end-user, the largest change is a new emphisis on:

  require 'facets'

This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-
intuitive, but it actually proves more advantantages to do this
for the sake of interoperability than the practice of cherry-picking.
The reason is simply because others may have cherry-picked different
methods, and those distinctions go unaccounted and untested.

Also with this release, to bolster the use of require 'facets',
some lack-luster extensions have been deprecated and namespace usage
has been improved. In addition, we are getting very close to full
ActiveSupport, and Ruby 1.9, interoperability. Expect this
to be complete in the next minor release or two.

This is still a bit of an early release. There remain a few 
libraries to adjust for the new design considerations, but I
wanted to get this new design out as soon as possible so others
could adjust their code sooner rather than later. I'll be catching
up on the CHANGES list over the next few minor release.

All method redirects are now in core, to ensure
