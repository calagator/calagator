  <h2><a name='about'>About us</a></h2>
  <h3>What</h3>

  <p>Tol-Calagator is a unified calendar for the technology community of Toledo, Ohio and the surrounding areas. It is a fork of the original Calagator project in use in Portland, Oregon. That can be found at http://calagator.org. We are grateful to the PDX community for open sourcing this great software. We are an all-volunteer effort and encourage anyone to import, create, and edit events. Calagator also refers to the open source software running this site.</p>

  <p>Calagator aggregates events so that users can visit a single source to discover interesting activities. Event organizers and participants share events with others through Calagator. Event planners use Calagator to check for possible scheduling conflicts, allowing them to make smarter decisions. Many people check the site regularly to find out what events they can attend each day.</p>

  <h3>Who</h3>

  <p>Calagator grew from a broad technology community discussion about how to find and share local events. The Calagator project started in January 2008 with the formation of a mailing list, followed by an initial code sprint a few weeks later. The group decided to build a public, non-commercial software project and website for sharing events.</p>

  <p>The software was developed through code sprints, where volunteers meet up to write and improve the application. The group used agile development methods from the start and has been able to provide a solid, functioning site from the first meeting on. Using these software development practices has helped developers share knowledge, made it easier for new developers to join in, and kept the code behind the application stable and maintainable. Although the application is written using Ruby on Rails, the group welcomes non-Ruby developers to participate. The code sprints also involve community members that contribute design, project direction, and documentation.</p>
